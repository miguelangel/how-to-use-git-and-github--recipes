Ingredients (6 to 8 servings)
 - 3 lb lb. Yukon Gold potatoes (6–8), peeled, cut into ¼” slices
- 2 teaspoon kosher salt plus more for seasoning
- 2 cups olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 10 large eggs, beaten to blend

Directions:
	DO AHEAD: Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature,
    
    1. Place potatoes in a large colander, sprinkle with 2 tsp. salt, and toss
	   to coat. Let stand for 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.

    2. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes 
       and cook, turning occasionally, until crisp-tender, 10–15 minutes.

    3. Add onion to potatoes in skillet; cook until onion and potatoes are soft,
       5–8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to a large bowl; 
       let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl; set aside.

    4. Add eggs to potato mixture; season with salt. Wipe out skillet. Heat ¼ cup
       reserved oil over medium-high heat (chill remaining oil for another use).
       Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge.

    5. Reduce heat to medium; cook tortilla until almost set (it will be slightly 
       runny on top), 25–30 minutes. Invert onto a large plate. Slide into skillet
       browned side up. Cook until golden on bottom and cooked through, about 4 
       minutes more. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cut into wedges.
